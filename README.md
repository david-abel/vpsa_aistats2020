# Value Preserving State-Action Abstractions
Code for running experiments associated with our 2020 AISTATS paper: [Value Preserving State-Action Abstractions](https://david-abel.github.io/papers/aistat2020_vpsa.pdf), by David Abel, Nathan Umbanhowar, Khimya Khetarpal, Dilip Arumugam, Doina Precup, and Michael L. Littman.

To run experiments, you will need [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl).

To reproduce Figure 2 run _phi_relative_options_experiments.py.py_

To reproduce any of the other figures in the Appendix, change which agent class is used in the above file. 

Please contact Dave with any questions (david_abel@alumni.brown.edu).
